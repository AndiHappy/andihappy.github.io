<p>In hindsight, two things went wrong â€“ we picked a terrible market and optimized the product for the wrong metrics of goodness.Each mistake likely cut RethinkDBâ€™s valuation by one to two orders of magnitudeï¼ˆæ•°é‡çº§ï¼‰. So if we got either of these right, RethinkDB would have been the size of MongoDB, and if we got both of them right, we eventually could have been the size of Red Hat[1].</p>
