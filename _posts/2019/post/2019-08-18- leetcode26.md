LeetCode 26.  Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array


描述：

~~~
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}

思路：

~~~
关键在于 in-place 操作，但是反过来想， in-place 操作也是算法提示的一种。
~~~

代码：

~~~
public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {

	public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
		if(nums == null || nums.length <2) return nums.length;
		int key = nums[0],cur = 1;
		for (int current = 1; current < nums.length; current++) {
			if(nums[current] != key){
				nums[cur] = nums[current];
				++cur;
				key = nums[current];
			}
		}
		return cur;
	}     
}
~~~

在比较一下标准的简练答案：
~~~
public int removeDuplicates(int[] A) {
    if (A.length<=1) return nums.length;
    int j=0;
    for (int i=0; i<A.length; i++)
        if (A[i]!=A[j]) A[++j]=A[i];
    return ++j;
}
