LeetCode 31.nextPermutation

题目一开始完全没有看懂，也不知道什么是next Permutation。知道排列，但是不知道next Permutation 是什么。这道题目的难点，全部的在于理解题意，并且找到翻转的规律。

描述：

~~~
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []

I don't think any one can understand this solution without seeing an example, 
here is an example:
2,3,6,5,4,1

Solution:
Step1, from right to left, 
find the first number which not increase in a ascending order. 
In this case which is 3.

Step2, here we can have two situations:

We cannot find the number, 
all the numbers increasing in a ascending order. 
This means this permutation is the last permutation,
 we need to rotate back to the first permutation. 
 So we reverse the whole array, 
 for example, 6,5,4,3,2,1 we turn it to 1,2,3,4,5,6.

We can find the number, then the next step, 
we will start from right most to leftward, 
try to find the first number which is larger than 3, 
in this case it is 4.
Then we swap 3 and 4, the list turn to 2,4,6,5,3,1.
Last, we reverse numbers on the right of 4,
we finally get 2,4,1,3,5,6.

Time complexity is: O(3*n)=O(n).

At the end, I don't know how to come up this solution. Here is just to understand the solution with example. Hope this helps.

代码：

public void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
      int n = nums.length - 1, p = -1, pv = 0;

      for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--){
        if(nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
            p = i;
            pv = nums[i];
            break;
        }
      }    
      
      if(p == -1) {
        reverse(nums, 0, n);
        return;
      }
      
      for(int i = n; i >= 0; i--){
        if(nums[i] > pv){
          swap(nums, p, i);
          break;
        }
      }
      
      reverse(nums, p + 1, n);
    }
    
    void reverse(int[] nums, int s, int e){
      while(s < e){
        swap(nums, s, e);
        s++;
        e--;
      }
    }
    
    void swap(int[] nums, int s, int e){
        int t = nums[s];
        nums[s] = nums[e];
        nums[e] = t;     
    }
