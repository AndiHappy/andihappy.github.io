描述：

~~~
Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. 
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 
Example 1:
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. 
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid. 


Constraints:
board.length == 9
board[i].length == 9
board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

首先明白具体的要求：

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

每一行，每一列，每一个3X3的小格子，都要求只有1到9个数对应具体的格子，不能有重复的元素。

具体的Note：
A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

没有答案的Sodoku也可能是有效的，也就说不要求找到具体Sudoku的答案。
根据提示的规则，只有需要被填充的格子，才需要校验，也就是说已经填充的格子，也就是有数字的格子需要校验

Input: board 的格式，也就是元素为.就不需要校验一下，并且校验的规则可分为三块：
一行，一列，每3X3的格子存在重复的元素

具体的代码为：

~~~java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
public class L36 {
    /**
     * 主要的是一种思维的方式
     * */
    public boolean isValidSudoku_simple(char[][] board) {
        Set seen = new HashSet();
        for (int i=0; i<9; ++i) {
            for (int j=0; j<9; ++j) {
                char number = board[i][j];
                if (number != '.')
                    if (!seen.add(number + " in row " + i) ||
                            !seen.add(number + " in column " + j) ||
                            !seen.add(number + " in block " + i/3 + "-" + j/3))
                        return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        for(int i = 0; i<9; i++){
            HashSet<Character> rows = new HashSet<Character>();
            HashSet<Character> columns = new HashSet<Character>();
            HashSet<Character> cube = new HashSet<Character>();
            for (int j = 0; j < 9;j++){
                if(board[i][j]!='.' && !rows.add(board[i][j])) return false;
                if(board[j][i]!='.' && !columns.add(board[j][i])) return false;
                int RowIndex = 3*(i/3);
                int ColIndex = 3*(i%3);
                if(board[RowIndex + j/3][ColIndex + j%3]!='.' && !cube.add(board[RowIndex + j/3][ColIndex + j%3]))
                    return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
