<p>What technologies to learn to land a remote job in 2018</p>

<!--more-->

<p>At this point in my career, I’m quite invested in the whole remote working, digital nomad shtick. My family, friends, and even strangers online now recognize me as the “guy who works in his pajamas from home”. So, perhaps I’m the man for the job when it comes to recommending technologies that will help propel you into this lifestyle.
Note: I focus primarily on software development, so if you’re a videographer or something, this post won’t provide as much value.</p>

<p>Before I just go off（进行） ranting about the technologies I believe will assist（帮助） you in getting a remote gig（演奏，临时工作）; there are a few attributes that may be beneficial, or in some cases required. For example, you’ll have a much better chance if you’re personable, have past experience working from home, or have existing clientele（委托人，顾客）. For now, though, let’s omit（to fail to include or do something） anything that falls under a similar category, I want to focus primarily on the tech.
Firstly, let’s focus on programming languages. I searched every popular language on several remote job sites that fit my criteria（a principle or standard by which something may be judged or decided.） (i.e. exclusively remote jobs to avoid on-site positions slipping through the cracks). One downside was most of these sites had 0 jobs available for certain languages. So, I resorted to StackOverflow for another metric, as it had remote jobs available for more obscure languages like Perl and R. StackOverflow jobs provided a solid baseline for remote jobs, and even did a superb job of filtering all on-site positions out.
The results
Obviously, these results are subject to change over the course of this year, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p>Results for 8 commonly used programming languages
Personally, I didn’t find this very surprising. Javascript has been growing exponentially for the past few years with the emergence of node.js and various front-end frameworks. Java, on the other hand is a tad bit interesting, because nearly all the jobs are senior positions. Python had a healthy mixture of web, machine learning, and data science jobs. Ruby is a little misleading because ALL of the jobs involved Ruby on Rails — the web framework (more on frameworks later). C++ and Go were very close, but I’d be willing to bet Go overtakes the former shortly.
One thing to note regarding Javascript is the over abundance of frameworks that have been hitting the scene for the past few years. I mention React quite a bit in my articles surrounding the remote job landscape. (Mostly because I contribute my first remote job to my capabilities using the framework.) Job searchers should still be seeing a consistent flow of React positions popping up. At the time of writing it was ahead of the race in terms of front-end frameworks, with angular close behind, and vue quickly picking up steam. With the rise of React Native in the mobile space, experience working in React has become even more beneficial. Not surprisingly, express is still far ahead of the other backend frameworks.
I would like to take a minute to talk about Ruby in a little more detail. I wrote above about all the positions being Ruby on Rails (the popular web framework), but interestingly I also spotted a lot of senior-level positions for the language. I presume the age of the language and framework has something a lot to do with this. As the language becomes less popular — not saying it’s “dying” by any stretch — the roles become a tad more demanding; at least that’s what I’ve come to find. So if you’re new to web development I’d avoid putting your eggs in the Ruby basket as it would be difficult to land a junior-level role.
Another language to zoom in on would be PHP. Frameworks like Laravel and Symfony are all the buzz right now, but we can’t dismiss WordPress. Admittedly, I did less research into the 8th ranked language on the list, but I found a majority of the positions to be WordPress. Furthermore, positions such as these were quite a bit less technical. After reading the requirements for a few postings, it was clear that they fell more into the creative/design side of things — UI, UX, PSD-to-HTML, all were common themes.
I’ll wrap up with a few words from my personal experience working and researching in this field. If you consider yourself “language agnostic” or a “T-shaped developer” you’ll have a much better chance of landing a remote job. I would consider myself very focused on React development, but I try to stay up to date on other technologies. A lot of co-workers ask how I know so much about something like Django, but spend no professional time working with the framework. The answer is quite simple, I love python and web development so I spend a lot of time reading about Django and building side-projects with the technology. I also dip my feet into WordPress every now and then because of freelance work that comes my way. It’s easy to excel in one particular language and maintain competency in another if the other interests you. A friend of mine works all day with node.js, but seems to be a master of 4–6 other tech stacks. She’s developed small games, created several bots, even dipped into machine learning. It’s her passion.</p>

<p><strong>So, my suggestion is to focus on a language that will bring you monetary and lifestyle results, but also pursue your passions and interests. I know it feels like you’re just wasting time if you play around with unpopular technologies, but you’re having fun, and that prevents burnout.</strong></p>
